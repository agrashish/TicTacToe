# TicTacToe
A simple JavaFX Server/Client implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe with an opponent you can't beat.
Built by Aashish Agrawal and Karan Ahuja for a class, some basic startup code provided by teacher Mark Hallenbeck.

This is a Maven Project, and can be run using "mvn exec:java". 
You must open a server instance using this command (the P3Project folder). 
A client can connect to the server (instantiated using the same command, from the P3Client Folder).
Then, the game begins. The client is always second.
